        <p class="lead mb-4">Welcome! My name is Joshua Fuentes and I am gonna tell you a little about myself. I am currently studying at the University of California Riverside as a freshman or a first year. I am currently a pre-business student who wants to major in Business Administration and have a concentration in Marketing. I was very involved in high school but currently in college I am only focusing on my studies to make sure I get the best grades in my first year. I haven't joined any clubs because I have heard that freshman year is usually the hardest out of the four years of college. This is because the transition from high school to college but even though this may be true I am trying to join a club for the next quarter.   <br><br>

        The clubs that I hopefully will be joining are ALPFA and also Latino Business Association. I also want to be able to join a community service club because I love to do it and I know that it makes a difference to the community. I have been volunteering since when I was in middle school so it has been a really big part of who I am and what I am passionate about. I usually volunteer around the city with Keep Riverside Clean and Beautiful. I am also very passionate about volleyball which I have only been in for two years. I love this sport because I love to be active and just show that I love being competitive and especially winning! I love this sport because you have to have teamwork and teamwork is a very important quality to have anywhere because it is something that will be used for a long time.  <br><br>

       I also want you to know that I am a person that loves to make new friends and being able to have quality time with my friends whenever I can I love to always have a good time and being able to have fun whenever I can because I love to be happy and also make other people happy. To me my friends are my family that I am able to lean on and be able to just tell them anything without being judged or hurt. The last thing that people need to know about me is that I am a person who loves their family. Family to me is everything they are the people that I can always count on and they will be there whenever I need them. I respect and cherish each word they say because my whole family has been there with me every step of the way of my life and I know that the words that they say I can eventually use in the future as advice. These are some things about me and hopefully you got to know me so much better by just reading this. Hopefully you keep looking at the whole website that I have made and hopefully you like it enough to make your own.
